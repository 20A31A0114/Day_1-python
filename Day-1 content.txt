does from right to left.

Python divides the operators in the following groups:

1)Arithmetic operators

MULTIPLE INPUTS IN SINGLE LINE:-
 In C++/C user can take multiple inputs in one line using scanf but in Python user can take multiple values or inputs in one line by two methods. 

Using split() method
Using List comprehension
